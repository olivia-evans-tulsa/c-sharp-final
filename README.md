# C# Final Project
Using a C# interface, this project receives user input in the form of a checked list-box, checkboxes, radio buttons, and an optional textbox element to filter an SQL database and return the user-defined output. (This makes more sense when opening the actual .sln file.)
This project draws from an SQL database, data source 2023-report.txt, which is included in the repository (*already converted into the database*). The source for that text file is actually a PDF, which, due to time constraints, was parsed and input to the text file by hand.
NOT ACCEPTING ANY PUSHES, for obvious reasons, this is a current work-in-progress which will be utilized as a C# class final.
